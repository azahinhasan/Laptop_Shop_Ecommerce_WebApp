## Description:
This one is the largest project so far, I have done myself. It’s a full-stack E-commerce Webapp with RESTful API. In this Webapp user can order Laptop and Laptop components. There are 2 main types of users. Which are Customer and Employee.  
Customer:- They can (also employees) search for any product and add them to the cart with quantity. Then they can Order also they can use Promo codes it will give them some offers if it’s a valid code. They can confirm the order with or without Login. And print the receipt. If the customer is registered and done this order by login then order information will store in the Database and he can check all orders and order’s current progress status and comment from employees if there is any in their Orders Page. From this page, he/she can also cancel the Order if the status is ‘none (no action take yet by Employee)’.  
Employee:- Three types in Employee: Admin, Moderator, Delivery Manager. Moderator and, Delivery Manager has some restriction. By default, the Delivery Manager can see all orders and update the progress status of orders (if the order is not canceled) and put a comment. Moderators can add, edit Product, and Promo code information. Admin can add new employees, modify access of any employee and modify salary info including the above options. And more.  
Every user can be stay login the same time in one browser. If he login from another browser the previous one will log out auto. And there are more features.
